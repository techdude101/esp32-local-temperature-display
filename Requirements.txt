// PHASE 1 (powered by USB)
1. Startup
2. POST (power on self test) - all segments are displayed for 1 second for each digit
3. Connect to WiFi (credentials hardcoded in firmware)
4. Retrieve current temperature (nearest weather station or data source hardcoded in firmware)
5. Display the 2-digit temperature on the 7-segment display


// PHASE 2 (powered by USB)
1. Startup
2. POST (power on self test) - all segments are displayed for 1 second for each digit
3. Connect to WiFi (credentials hardcoded in firmware)
	- Error connecting to WiFi -> not handled yet
4. Retrieve current temperature (nearest weather station or data source stored in firmware)
	- Error retrieving temperature -> not handled yet
5. Display the 2-digit temperature on the 7-segment display for 30 seconds
LOOP
6. Enter low power mode (turn off WiFi etc...)
7. Wakeup when motion is detected
8. Connect to WiFi
9. Retrieve current temperature
10. Display the 2-digit temperature on the 7-segment display for 30 seconds

// PHASE 3 (powered by USB)
1. Startup
2. POST (power on self test) - all segments are displayed for 1 second for each digit
3. Connect to WiFi (credentials hardcoded in firmware)
	- Error connecting to WiFi -> Display F1 short for WiFi on the display
4. Retrieve current temperature (nearest weather station or data source stored in firmware)
	- Error retrieving temperature -> Display 째C to indicate an error retrieving or parsing temperature (segments a, b, f & g) for 째 symbol
5. Display the 2-digit temperature on the 7-segment display for 30 seconds
LOOP
6. Enter low power mode (turn off WiFi etc...)
7. Wakeup when motion is detected
8. Connect to WiFi
9. Retrieve current temperature
10. Display the 2-digit temperature on the 7-segment display for 30 seconds

// PHASE 4 (powered by battery)
// CONFIGURATION
1. Startup
2. POST (power on self test) - all segments are displayed for 1 second for each digit
3. WiFi station for 1 minute to enable configuration
4. Client connects within 1 minute, 1 minute timer stops until client disconnects OR configuration has been successful
5. Reset & connect to WiFi with new configuration

// NORMAL OPERATION
1. Startup
2. POST (power on self test) - all segments are displayed for 1 second for each digit
3. Connect to WiFi (credentials stored in device memory e.g. EEPROM / FLASH)
	- Error connecting to WiFi -> Display F1 short for WiFi on the display
4. Retrieve current temperature (nearest weather station or data source stored in device memory e.g. EEPROM / FLASH)
	- Error retrieving temperature -> Display 째C to indicate an error retrieving or parsing temperature (segments a, b, f & g) for 째 symbol
5. Display the 2-digit temperature on the 7-segment display for 30 seconds
